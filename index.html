            <h3>Why Crete?</h3>
            <p>"Crete is the largest island in Greece, and the fifth largest one in the Mediterranean Sea. Here, you can
                admire the
                remnants of brilliant civilizations, explore glorious beaches, impressive mountainscapes, fertile
                valleys and steep
                gorges, and become part of the island’s rich gastronomic culture. Crete is, after all, a small universe
                teeming with
                beauties and treasures that you will probably need a lifetime to uncover!" <br /> - Visit Greece</p>

                    <h4>Peskesi</h4>
                    <p>This restaurant is definitely more on the sophisticated side, with its unique recipes and
                        well-researched aesthetic. But don't expect lousy portions, we are still in Crete after all!
                        Their plates are innovative takes on modern cretese cuisine made with a carefully selected
                        choice of local ingredients. If you go be sure to book in advance and arrive hungry, you don't
                        want to miss a single course here, and make sure to try their homemade bread dipped in a
                        selection of greek olive-oils.</p>

                    <p>I was in Heraklion for three days, of the six main meals I could eat while there I ate 5 at
                        Peskesi. Honestly, if I could magically transport their flavours to Europe I would, I already
                        regularly come home with at least two bottles of their olive oil, Ryanair be damned. I don't
                        even know what I could suggest here, except to go as many times as possible, it's worth it.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever wanted to feel like a fisherman? This is the right place! At this highly rated
                        restaurant you will eat delicious, fresh fish with your feet in the sand. However, it is perfect
                        for a fancy romantic dinner as the tableware is sophisticated and the atmosphere at sunset is
                        magical, with specially prepared lights that turn on after dark. They serve all sorts of fresh
                        fish, simply prepared, just choose your catch and whether you want it grilled, sautèed or fried.

                    <h5>What's to like</h5>
                    <p>It was one of my favourite dinners of my holiday to Crete with my boyfriend. We ate loads of new
                        fish (including shark!) and we never felt rushed by the staff. This was also the one place I
                        would organise an entire new holiday around. There are no human expressions fit to describe the
                        taste of their fried calamari.</p>

                    <h4>Taverna Leventis</h4>
                    <p>Traditional plates from Crete are served in this remote Taverna in the Chania province. While you
                        can only reach it by car, it is well worth the trouble, the food is as plentiful as the locals
                        and every single dish will vanish off your plate. Do not forget to have some fried snails and
                        some "antichrist" (fun name for a local lamb dish), they are local specialties.</p>

                    <h5>What's to like</h5>
                    <p>My favourite part, apart from the atmosphere created by huge greek families eating and laughing
                        all around us, was definitely the chance to eat so well in a beautiful place. Finger-licking
                        food, so good the local cats hang around like vultures, and the best possible view of the sunset
                        on the hills. Best to go early, but you can easily stay seated for 3-4 hours for your meal, you
                        won't be kicked out!</p>

            <p>I am an Italian foodie and travel enthusiast. I have always loved travelling to Greece because of the
                huge cultural baggage of the country as much as for the splendid sea and delicious food. However, I have
                been unable to forget Crete, the island is just special. Listen to the Greeks, go visit Crete.</p>
